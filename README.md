Futures Trading Assistant (V0)

A Python-based futures trading assistant designed to store trades, scrape trade history from Topstep, and eventually provide performance analytics, journaling, and automation tools.
This is an early V0 draft focused on building the core architecture.

Project Status: V0 (Work in Progress)

Current V0 goals:
Project structure created
JSON storage engine implemented
Login and scraper modules drafted
Modular system prepared for scraping, parsing, storage, and analytics

Upcoming in V0.1–V1:
Complete Selenium scraper
Add duplicate-trade protection
Implement cleaned trade data format
Add basic analytics (win rate, average win, average loss)
